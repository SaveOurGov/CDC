emm236.2 (formerly stS104.2) subtype determining sequence. Identity to 
bases 31-180 (encodes mature N-terminus) and ungapped identity or near-
identity to complete 180 base sequence defines this subtype.
emm236.2 from invasive GAS isolate 5317-08(T8) recovered in U.S.
during 2007-2008. Corresponds to the enn gene sequence that lies 
immediately downstream of emm gene in types emm4, emm9, emm89, and  . . .
