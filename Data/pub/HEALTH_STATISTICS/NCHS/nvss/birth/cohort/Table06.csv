"Table 6. Cumulative birth rates, by live-birth order, exact age, and race of women in selected groups of cohorts from 1912-1916 through 1987-1991: United States, 1961-2006",,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[A cohort is identified by the year in which the women were born. Because these women retain this designation throughout their childbearing years, their fertility can be followed over time. Live-birth order refers to number of children born alive to mother. Cumulative birth rates are the sums of central birth rates for the 5-year age cohorts up to the specified age. Rates are per 1,000 women.  For method of computation, see Technical Appendix to the Cohort Fertility Tables]",,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOTES: Data for 1985-2005 are based on 100 percent of births. Data for 1972-1984 are based on 100 percent of births in selected states and on a 50 percent sample of births in all other states. Data for 1960-1966 and 1968-1971 are based on a 50 percent sample of births. Data for 1967 are based on a 20 percent to 50 percent sample of births. For 1992 and later years, unknown race of mother is imputed. The multiple-race data for reporting states (i.e., those states reporting more than one race in a given year) for 2003-2005 were bridged to the single-race categories of the 1977 Office of Management and Budget standards for comparability with nonreporting states (i.e., those states reporting only one race in a given year). Multiple-race reporting areas vary for 2003-2005. Data by race for New Jersey are estimated for 1962 and 1963.
