                     WARNING - DATA USE RESTRICTIONS!
                       Read Carefully before Using

    The Public Health Service Act (Section 308 (d)) provides that the data
    collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), may be used only for the
    purpose of health statistical reporting and analysis.

    Any effort to determine the identity of any reported case is prohibited
    by this law.

    NCHS does all it can to assure that the identity of data subjects cannot
    be disclosed.  All direct identifiers, as well as any characteristics 
    that might lead to identification, are omitted from the dataset.  Any
    intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment
    violates the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the
    information.  Therefore, users will:

       1.  Use the data in this dataset for statistical reporting and
           analysis only.

       2.  Make no use of the identity of any person or establishment
           discovered inadvertently and advise the Director, NCHS, of any
           such discovery.

       3.  Not link this dataset with individually identifiable data from
           other NCHS or non-NCHS datasets.

    By using these data, you signify your agreement to comply with the 
    above-stated statutorily based requirements.

The files listed below comprise the 1992 NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS)
data files.  The data files are  in ASCII Format and the documentation files are in WordPerfect
5.1/5.2 format.
   
 The 1992 NHEFS datasets are located in: 
     ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHEFS/NHEFS92
 The documentation files for the 1992 NHEFS datasets are located in:
     ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHEFS/NHEFS92

For ease of transmission, the 1992 NHEFS datasets have been converted into a self-extracting
compressed format.  To load and expand any of the NHEFS data files, do the following:   First,
copy the compressed file onto your hard drive into an appropriate subdirectory.  For example, the
data file INT92DAT.EXE should be copied into a subdirectory called INT92.  Then, go to that
directory and type INT92DAT without the EXE extension. INT92DAT.EXE will extract into the
file INT92.DAT.  This file can then be used for processing by PC SAS or uploaded to a
mainframe computer for processing.
   
The five datasets listed below have each been compressed into self-extracting files.  To load and
expand each of them, follow the steps above using the appropriate file name.

WARNING: The INTERVIEW is extremely large in size, please use caution as far as disk
drive capacity when extracting!  Additionally, please use caution when uploading to a
mainframe, transmission time is extremely long depending on hardware and software used.

For ease of transmission, the 1992 NHEFS data documentation files have been converted into a
self-extracting compressed format.  To load and expand any of the NHEFS data documentation files, do
the following:   First, copy the compressed file onto your hard drive into an appropriate subdirectory. For
example, the documentation files INT92INT.EXE should be copied into a subdirectory called INT92. 
Then go to that directory and type INT92INT without the EXE extension. INT92INT.EXE will extract
into the file INT92INT.DOC.  This file can then be brought into a wordprocessor.
   
The eleven documentation files listed below have each been compressed into self-extracting files.  To load
and expand each of them, follow the steps above using the appropriate file name.

NOTE: Due to its size, the 1992 NHEFS Interview documentation has been divided into several
portions for ease in transmission.

CAUTION - Public use data tapes are available for each of the four completed waves of NHEFS. 
However, at this time only the five public use data tapes released for the 1992 NHEFS are available via
the FTP server.  The 1982-84, 1986, and 1987 Interview and Health Care Facility Stay Public Use Data
Tapes must still be purchased through NTIS. 

The 1992 NHEFS Vital and Tracing Status Public Use Data Tape contains vital status, tracing and
demographic information on all examined subjects 25 years or older at NHANES I (n=14,407).  It also
provides users with information on the availability of different survey components for each of the four
followup periods for each subject.  The 1992 Mortality Data tape contains death certificate information
collected for each followup period (1982-84, 1986, 1987, and 1992) coded according to ICD-9
multiple-cause-of-death procedures for all 4,497 NHEFS decedents identified through 1992.  A survey
period identifier variable is provided to allow the researcher to select mortality information for each of
the four followup periods. The 1992 Interview data tapes contain information collected from the subject
and proxy interviews conducted during the 1992 NHEFS data collection period. The 1982-84, 1986,
and 1987 Interview tapes (available from NTIS) contain the interview information collected during each
of these earlier NHEFS survey periods.  When merged together, these files provide a complete followup
health history for each subject from baseline through the last completed interview. The 1992 Health Care
Facility Stay tape contains information collected regarding  overnight stays in health care facilities
reported during the 1992 NHEFS survey period.  The Supplemental Health Care Facility Stay data tape
has been created to provide information which was received during the 1992 followup period but which
describes overnight facility stays that occurred prior to the 1992 followup period.  The 1982-84, 1986,
and 1987 Health Care Facility tapes (available from NTIS) contain information collected for overnight
health care facility stays reported during the previous NHEFS data collection periods.  When all five
Health Care Facility Stay data files are merged together, they provide a history of all reported
hospitalizations and institutionalizations from baseline through 1992.

Data from the 1992 NHEFS public use data tapes should be linked to the 1982-84, 1986, and 1987
NHEFS and NHANES I public-use data files for the proper analysis of longitudinal data.   Data users
are directed to consult the Vital and Statistics Series 1 Reports Nos. 22, 25, 27 and 35 for
information regarding the plan and operation of the NHEFS surveys.  A Vital and Health Statistics
Series 2, Report No. 121 has been issued to assist data users with resolving statistical issues and the
proper use of sample weights when analyzing the NHEFS data.  Please refer to
http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/products/products.htm for additional information on  these Reports.  The
data collected in the NHEFS surveys is longitudinal by design and therefore should, in most cases, not
be used to provide prevalence estimates.
